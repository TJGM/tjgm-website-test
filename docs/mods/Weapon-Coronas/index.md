# Weapon Coronas

!!! warning
    This mod is now outdated, although I still keep it here for archival purposes. If you want weapon coronas, I suggest using [this mod](https://www.mixmods.com.br/2020/09/glowing-pickups-weapon-coronas/) instead.

## What is it?

Rockstar decided to remove the coronas from dropped weapons when San Andreas came around, it was a nice feature in III/VC that gave the game atmosphere. This mod adds coronas to weapons similar to III/VC, although not perfect, I think it suits the game and looks pretty good.
