# How to Downgrade EVERY Version of GTA III

## Introduction

!!! info

    This guide **IS NOT** for *Grand Theft Auto: III - The Definitive Edition* which released in 2021. This guide is **ONLY** for the original *Grand Theft Auto: III* released in 2002.
    
    The only reason you should downgrade GTA III is if you want to mod the game. If you're not going to mod, you should stick with the latest version of GTA III.

Depending on the copy of GTA III you have, downgrading may be different, so this guide will be split into different sections for the Steam, Rockstar Games Launcher and DVD copies of the game. Press one of the buttons below to be taken to the section of the guide for whichever copy you have.

## Downgrading the Steam Version of GTA III

!!! warning

    Make sure you launch Grand Theft Auto: III at least once on Steam before downgrading. If you don't do a first time launch before downgrading, Steam will possibly update GTA III and undo the downgrader!

- Step 1: Download the **TJGM GTA III Downgrader** from either [Mega](https://mega.nz/file/gqY2mYrD#0cMoT2sPQyu0_Uu0-Q19aMvViPqwZwuAIDk2oNr6hqw) or [Mediafire](https://www.mediafire.com/file/0zhp9olrt3p0vuf/TJGM_GTA_III_Downgrader.zip/file).
- Step 2: Open your GTA III folder. You can find this by right clicking **"Grand Theft Auto: III"** in your Steam library, go to **"Manage"** and then click **"Browse local files"** from the menu. You should see the GTA III files like this.

- Step 3: Open the **TJGM GTA III Downgrader** archive you downloaded and place all of the files from the archive, into the GTA III folder. Replace all of the files when asked.

The Steam version of GTA III is now downgraded, however unlike Vice City and San Andreas, GTA III will throw an error once you launch it asking you to insert a CD. You can fix this by installing SilentPatch, a mod which fixes a huge number of issues with GTA III. Let's quickly do it.

- Step 6: Download SilentPatch from the link in the description.
- Step 7: Open the **SilentPatch** archive you downloaded and place **"SilentPatchIII.asi"** and **"SilentPatchIII.ini"** from the archive, into the GTA III folder.

And that's it, the Steam version of GTA III is now downgraded.

!!! tip

    If Rockstar for some reason ever updates the Steam version of GTA III again, it will revert the downgrader and if you have mods installed, it will break your mods. It's *very* unlikely they'll update GTA III now as it's no longer for sale on Steam, but there's still a *very small* possibility.

    So you have two options.
    
    - Option A: You take the *really* small risk and continue to launch GTA III through Steam.

    - Option B: You rename your GTA III folder to literally anything else so Steam will no longer detect it. The downside to this is, you won't be able to launch the game through Steam, but instead you can launch the game by clicking **"gta3.exe"**.

    It's up to you really. Neither will have any impact on your playing experience and this is mostly just a precaution.

## Downgrading the Rockstar Games Launcher Version of GTA III

!!! warning

    Rockstar Games Launcher restricts your ability to modify game files without administrator approval. This is a problem because some mods will need to change files as you play, and unless you run the game as an admin, which I really wouldn't recommend, mods won't work correctly.

    Along with that, Rockstar Games Launcher will also update your game anytime files are modified, undoing your changes. This will also reset permissions on the games folder even if you change it.

    The best solution to these issues is to simply copy your GTA III folder, and paste it somewhere where administrator approval isn't required. This will be our first steps.

- Step 1: Open your GTA III folder. You can find this by clicking on **"Settings"** in the Rockstar Games Launcher, click GTA III in your installed games list, find **"View installation folder"** and then click **"Open"** next to it. You should see the GTA III files like this.

- Step 2: Click on **"Rockstar Games"** in the address bar to go just outisde the GTA III folder and then copy and paste your GTA III folder to another location on your PC. I'd recommend copying the game to a generic games folder outside of Program Files, or on another drive.
    
    !!! warning
        Make sure you copy and paste the game, don't cut and paste it. Cutting and pasting the game will carry over the restrictive permissions from Rockstar Games Launcher, which you don't want.

- Step 3: Check if you can modify the pasted game folder without admin approval. You can check this by right clicking anywhere in your game folder, go to **"New"** in the context menu, and if the option to create a new folder hasn't got the little shield icon next to it, you're all set to go.

    If you still have the shield icon next to the new folder option, copy the game folder again and paste it somewhere else on your system that isn't as restrictive.

- Step 4: Download the **TJGM GTA III Downgrader** from either [Mega](https://mega.nz/file/gqY2mYrD#0cMoT2sPQyu0_Uu0-Q19aMvViPqwZwuAIDk2oNr6hqw) or [Mediafire](https://www.mediafire.com/file/0zhp9olrt3p0vuf/TJGM_GTA_III_Downgrader.zip/file).
- Step 5: Open the **TJGM GTA III Downgrader** archive you downloaded and place all of the files from the archive, into the GTA III folder. Replace all of the files when asked.

!!! tip
    You can delete your original Rockstar Games Launcher copy of the game to save space on your PC.

## Downgrading the DVD Version of GTA III

- Step 1: Install GTA III from the DVD onto your PC. When installing, make sure **YOU DON'T** install the game in Program Files, I'd recommend installing it in a generic games folder outside of Program Files, or on another drive entirely. Remember *exactly* where you install GTA III and when the game is installed, open the GTA III folder.
- Step 2: Download the **TJGM GTA III Downgrader** from either [Mega](https://mega.nz/file/gqY2mYrD#0cMoT2sPQyu0_Uu0-Q19aMvViPqwZwuAIDk2oNr6hqw) or [Mediafire](https://www.mediafire.com/file/0zhp9olrt3p0vuf/TJGM_GTA_III_Downgrader.zip/file).
- Step 3: Open the **TJGM GTA III Downgrader** archive you downloaded and place all of the files from the archive, into the GTA III folder. Replace all of the files when asked.

- Step 5: Open the **SilentPatch** archive you downloaded and place **"SilentPatchIII.asi"** and **"SilentPatchIII.ini"** from the archive, into the GTA III folder.

And that's it, your DVD copy of GTA III is now downgraded. After downgrading, you don't need the DVD to launch the game anymore. You can launch GTA III by clicking "gta3.exe".

## Questions and Answers

### What is the difference between your downgrader and others?

Unfortunately downgraders have been a bit of a mess in the GTA community, overcomplicating the downgrading process. So I've made mine as simple as possible.

Some downgraders come as actual installers, however these often have issues on certain systems or require admin permission to work. There's also downgraders that come with mods prepacked, however this is an issue as the mods can often be outdated OR users will get these mods from these overcomplicated downgraders, not realise what they have installed, then when they mod the game themselves, they reinstall the same mods, causing issues with their game.

Lastly, a lot of downgraders simply come with the wrong .exe, as there's several 1.0 exe's from different regions. My downgrader comes with the most mod compatible .exe.
