# Fusion Overloader Tutorial

## Introduction

If you’re not aware, GTA IV secretly has a way to load modified game files without actually replacing the games original files.

If you create a folder called “update” in your GTA IV folder and added an IMG archive called “update.img”, any modified files you put into this IMG archive, will be used over the games original files. Assuming the files you’re modifying were in an IMG archive to begin with.

## Fusion Overloader

So the modding community took advantage of this "update" folder once they discovered it in the 2020s, and the result was Fusion OverLoader, a Modloader for GTA IV that makes use of the “update” folder and makes it so it can load any type of game files, not just files located in IMG archives.

This allows you to install mods with a simple drag and drop, without actually replacing game files, without needing additional tools and without needing to make backups of your game files.

It can be a bit confusing how it works, but I’m going to cover everything you need to know in this guide.

## Installing Fusion Overloader

Fusion Overloader isn't really its own mod, rather it's a component of Ultimate ASI Loader, a mod which works on hundreds of games and allows modders to make ASI plugins for any game that supports it.

While you can install Ultimate ASI Loader on its own for GTA IV, the mod actually comes packaged with Fusion Fix already, a mod you *should* be using if you're playing GTA IV on PC. If you haven't got Fusion Fix installed, I'd recommend
following my Fixing GTA IV with 4 Mods guide to install it and some other vital mods.

For GTA IV, Ultimate ASI Loader is called **"dinput8.dll"**. For other games, it might be named differently.

Once this file is in the game folder, Fusion Overloader is active and you're ready to use the "update" folder.
