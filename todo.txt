Add comments to main index.md so I understand how to quickly update the news section and other sections.

Completely finish mods section cards on home page and at least finish improved 2dfx page.

Write out website layout standards. e.g. homepage is customised, standard pages should be as basic as possible except for comparison section.

Optimize home page

Clean up mkdocs.yml

Before and after captions don't fit correctly if images are in spoiler

Before and after captions and full screen button need to scale

    Comparison verticle line goes over header when scrolling, need to fix

Extend full screen button to all images

    Fix logos in stripes

Fix headers on homepage, some use ## and some use <h2></h2>

Fix scaling at 4K (fixed I think, check ultrawide with Stephen)

Change mod links to open in their own page

    Update all images to .webp
